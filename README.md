# stock-frontend (Stock Tracker)
Nick Moore

Built with Vue and CSS Grid

Setup and install instructions below in the Project Setup notes.

Notes:
I noticed some extra colors (Drop shadows and the color for the numbers in the stats section).
I didn't get completed on the styling, I mainly focused on the API and getting the data.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```
